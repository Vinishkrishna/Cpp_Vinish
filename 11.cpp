    //Runtime error :
    /*1)One trying to access a memory location whose access is illegal(segmentation error)
    2)try to access a location by pointer which is illegal / try to access a null pointer which is not initialised
    3)Undefined behavior in code(division by zero)
    4)negative indexes not allowed in c and c++
    5)Some have many recursion function calls so recursion stack fills quickly at that time it shows run time error but execution time for question is still has't passed.(Sometimes memory limit exceeded is also shown here)*/
    /*TLE*/
    // Code running should run for less execution time than given in question
    //if recursion happens for long time ,recursion stack has still space for filling new recursions but before which time limit exceeded for the question
